# Hyperskill_Kotlin_Watermark

This was the 5th project I completed as part of Jetbrain Academy's "Kotlin Basics" course

It is rated as a hard difficulty project. It tasks the student with creating a program that applies watermarks to images.
This project helped familiarize me with design patterns and using IntelliJ IDEA's integrated debugging tools

I was expecting to do a bit more with image manipulation in this project, but there was a greater focus here on debugging and error handling. Something I was welcome to learn, just not what I expected.

I have also included the tests that Hyperskill uses to determine if a project is complete.
